which they shall judge most expedient, for settling such
a complete and final adjustment as may best tend to improve

<p class="right">G. R.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt</span> <i>rose, and spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p class="salutation">SIR,</p>

<p>When I proposed to the House, the last time
this subject was before them, to fix this day for the
further consideration of His Majesty’s Message, I
certainly indulged the hope that the result of a similar
communication to the Parliament of Ireland would
have opened a more favourable Prospect, than at
present exists, of the speedy accomplishment of a
measure which I then stated, and which I still consider,
to be of the greatest importance to the power,
the stability, and the general welfare of the Empire;
to the immediate interests of both Kingdoms; and
more particularly to the peace, the tranquillity,
and the safety of Ireland: in this hope, I am sorry
to say, I have for the present been disappointed, by
the proceedings of the Irish House of Commons, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
which we have been informed since this subject
was last under consideration.</p>

<p>I feel and know that the Parliament of Ireland
possesses the power, the intire competence, on the
behalf of that country, alike to accept or reject
a proposition of this nature—a power which I am
by no means inclined to dispute. I see that at
the present moment one House of Parliament
in Ireland has expressed a repugnance, even to
the consideration of this measure. Feeling, Sir,
as I have already stated, that it is important,
not only as it tends to the general prosperity
of the Empire of Great Britain, but (what,
under every situation, must always be to me an
object of the greatest moment) feeling that it was
designed and calculated to increase the prosperity
and ensure the safety of Ireland, I must have seen
with the deepest regret that, at the very first
moment, and before the nature of the measure
could be known, it was so received.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been my feelings upon
this subject, knowing that it is the undoubted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
right of the Legislature of Ireland to reject or to
adopt such measures as may appear to them injurious
or beneficial, far be it from me to speak
of its determination in any other terms but those
of respect. Let it not, therefore, be imagined
that I am inclined to press any sentiment, however
calculated it may appear to me to benefit
every member of the Empire, in any manner
which may lead to hostile discussion between two
Kingdoms, whose mutual happiness and safety
depend upon their being strictly and cordially
united. But while I admit and respect the rights
of the Parliament of Ireland, I feel that, as a
Member of the Parliament of Great Britain, I
also have a Right to exercise, and a Duty to perform.
That Duty is to express, as distinctly as I
can, the general nature and outline of the Plan,
which, in my conscience, I think would tend in
the strongest manner to ensure the safety and
the happiness of both Kingdoms.</p>

<p>While I feel, therefore, that as long as the
House of Commons of Ireland view the subject
in the light they do at present, there is no chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of its adoption, I do not think that I ought on
that account to abstain from submitting it to the
consideration of this Parliament; on the contrary,
I think it only the more necessary to explain
distinctly the principles of the Measure, and
to state the grounds upon which it appears
to me to be entitled to the approbation of the
Legislature.</p>

<p>If Parliament, when it is in possession of the
basis upon which this Plan is founded, and of its
general outline, should be of opinion with me,
that it is founded upon fair, just, and equitable
principles, calculated to produce mutual advantages
to the two Kingdoms—if Parliament, I say,
upon full explanation, and after mature deliberation,
should be of that opinion, I should propose
that its determination should remain recorded as
that by which the Parliament of Great Britain
is ready to abide, leaving to the Legislature of
Ireland to reject or to adopt it hereafter, upon a
full consideration of the subject.</p>

<p>There is no man who will deny that in a great
question of this nature, involving in it objects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
which, in the first instance, are more likely to be
decided upon by passion than by judgment; in a
question in which an honest but, I must be allowed
to say, a mistaken sense of National Pride is so
likely to operate, that much misconstruction and
misconception must inevitably happen. It therefore
becomes the more necessary that the intentions
of the Government which proposes the Measure,
and the principles of the Measure itself, should be
distinctly understood. But, Sir, in stating that
intention and those principles, I look to something
more than a mere vindication of Government for
having proposed the Measure. I do entertain a
confidence, even under the apparent discouragement
of the opinion expressed by the Irish House
of Commons, that this Measure is founded
upon such clear, such demonstrable grounds of
utility, is so calculated to add to the strength
and power of the Empire, (in which the safety
of Ireland is included, and from which it never
can be separated) and is attended with so many
advantages to Ireland in particular, that all that
can be necessary for its ultimate adoption is, that
it should be stated distinctly, temperately, and
fully, and that it should be left to the unprejudiced,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the dispassionate, the sober judgment of
the Parliament of Ireland. I wish that those
whose interests are involved in this measure
should have time for its consideration—I wish
that time should be given to the Landed, to the
Mercantile, and Manufacturing Interest, that they
should look at it in all its bearings, and that they
should coolly examine and sift the popular arguments
by which it has been opposed, and that
then they should give their deliberate and final
judgment.</p>

<p>I am the more encouraged in this hope of the
ultimate success of this measure, when I see, notwithstanding
all the prejudices which it has excited,
that barely more than one-half of the members
that attended the House of Commons were
adverse to it; and that in the other House of Parliament
in Ireland, containing, as it does, so large
a portion of the property of that kingdom, it was
approved of by a large majority.—When I have
reason to believe that the sentiments of a large part
of the People of that Country are favourable to it;
and that much of the Manufacturing, and of the
Commercial Interest of Ireland are already sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
how much it is calculated to promote their advantage,
I think, when it is more deliberately examined,
and when it is seen in what temper it is here
proposed and discussed, that it will still terminate
in that which can alone be a fortunate result.</p>

<p>It would be vain indeed to hope that a proposition
upon which prejudices are so likely to operate,
and which is so liable to misconception,
should be unanimously approved. But the approbation
I hope for is, that of the Parliament of
Ireland, and of the intelligent part of the Public
of that Country. It is with a view to this object
that I think it my duty to bring this measure forward
at present; not for the sake of urging its
immediate adoption, but that it may be known
and recorded; that the intention of the British
Parliament may be known, in the hope that it
will produce similar sentiments among our Countrymen
in Ireland. With this view it is my intention
not to go at present into any detailed statement
of the plan, because should it ultimately be
adopted, the minuter parts must necessarily become
the objects of much distinct discussion; but
to give such a general statement of the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the measure as will enable the House to form a
correct judgment upon it.</p>

<p>I shall therefore, Sir, before I sit down, open
to the House a string of Resolutions, comprising
the general heads of this plan. It will be necessary
for me, for the purpose of discussing those
Resolutions with regularity and convenience, to
move that the House should resolve itself into a
Committee. And I have already stated, that it is
not my intention then to press the Committee to
come to an immediate decision upon the Resolutions;
but if, upon full and deliberate examination,
the Resolutions which I shall have the honour
to propose, and which contain as much as is necessary
for an outline of the plan, shall be approved,
my opinion is, that nothing can contribute
more to obviate any doubts and dissatisfaction
which may exist, than that Parliament should
adopt those Resolutions, and that it should then
humbly lay them at the foot of the Throne, leaving
it to <span class="smcap">His Majesty’s</span> wisdom to communicate
them to the Parliament of Ireland, whenever
circumstances should appear favourable to such
a Measure. I shall therefore, Sir, proceed as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
shortly as I can to state to the House the nature,
of the Resolutions, and of the Address which
I shall propose to accompany them, if it
should be the pleasure of the House to adopt
them.</p>

<p>Having now, Sir, explained to the House the
mode I mean to pursue, and my reasons for persisting,
under the present circumstances, in submitting
this Measure to the consideration of Parliament,
I will endeavour to state the general
grounds on which it rests, the general arguments
by which it is recommended, and to give a short
view of the outline of the Plan.</p>

<p>As to the general principle upon which, the
whole of this Measure is founded, I am happy to
observe, from what passed upon a former occasion,
that there is not a probability of any difference
of opinion. The general principle, to
which both sides of the House perfectly acceded,
is, that a perpetual Connection between Great
Britain and Ireland is essential to the interests of
both. The only Honourable Gentleman who,
when this subject was before the House on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
former day, opposed the consideration of the Plan
altogether, stated, in terms as strong as I could
wish, the necessity of preserving the strictest
Connection between the two Countries. I most
cordially agree with him in that opinion, but I
then stated, that I do not barely wish for the maintenance
of that Connection as tending to add
to the general strength of the Empire, but I wish
for the maintenance of it with a peculiar regard
to the local interests of Ireland, with a regard to
every thing that can give to Ireland its due weight
and importance, as a great member of the Empire.
I wish for it with a view of giving to that
Country the means of improving all its great
natural Resources, and of giving it a full participation
of all those blessings which this Country
so eminently enjoys.</p>

<p>Considering the subject in this point of view,
and assuming it as a proposition not to be controverted,
that it is the duty of those who wish
to promote the Interest and Prosperity of both
Countries, to maintain the strongest connection
between them, let me ask, what is the situation of
Affairs that has called us to the discussion of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
subject? This very connection, the necessity of
which has been admitted on all hands, has been
attacked by Foreign Enemies, and by Domestic
Traitors. The dissolution of this connection is
the great object of the hostility of the common
Enemies of both Countries, it is almost the only
remaining hope with which they now continue the
contest. Baffled and defeated as they have
hitherto been, they still retain the hope, they are
still meditating attempts, to dissolve that connection.
In how many instances already the defeat of
their hostile designs has been turned to the confirmation
of our Strength and Security, I need not enumerate.
God grant that in this instance the same
favour of Divine Providence, which has in so
many instances protected this Empire, may again
interpose in our favour, and that the attempts of
the Enemy to separate the two Countries, may
tend ultimately to knit them more closely together,
to strengthen a Connection, the best
pledge for the happiness of both, and so add to
that power which forms the chief barrier to the
civilized world, against the destructive principles,
the dangerous projects, and the unexampled usurpation
of France. This Connection has been
attacked not only by the avowed Enemies of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Countries, but by internal Treason, acting in concert
with the designs of the Enemy. Internal
Treason, which ingrafted Jacobinism on those
diseases which necessarily grew out of the State
and Condition of Ireland.</p>

<p>Thinking, then, as we all must think, that a
close Connection with Ireland is essential to the
interests of both Countries, and seeing how much
this Connection is attacked, let it not be insinuated
that it is unnecessary, much less improper,
at this arduous and important crisis, to see whether
some new arrangements, some fundamental
regulations, are not necessary, to guard against
the threatened danger. The foreign and domestic
Enemies of these Kingdoms have shewn, that
they think this the vulnerable point in which We
may be most successfully attacked; let us derive
advantage, if we can, from the hostility of our
Enemies—let us profit by the designs of those
who, if their conduct displays no true wisdom,
at least possess in an eminent degree that
species of wisdom which is calculated for the promotion
of mischief. They know upon what footing
that Connection rests at this moment between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the two Countries, and they feel the most ardent
hope, that the two Parliaments will be infatuated
enough not to render their designs abortive, by
fixing that Connection upon a more solid basis.</p>

<p>These circumstances I am sure will not be
denied. And if upon other grounds we had any
doubt, these circumstances alone ought to induce
us, deliberately and dispassionately, to review the
situation of the two Countries, and to endeavour
to find out a proper remedy for an evil, the existence
of which is but too apparent. It requires
but a moment’s reflection, for any man who has
marked the progress of events, to decide upon
the true state and character of this Connection.
It is evidently one which does not afford that security
which, even in times less dangerous and less
critical than the present, would have been necessary,
to enable the empire to avail itself of its
strength and its resources.</p>

<p>When I last addressed the House on this subject,
I stated that the settlement, which was made
in 1782, so far from deserving the name of a
Final Adjustment, was one that left the Connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
between Great Britain and Ireland exposed
to all the attacks of Party, and all the effects of
accident. That Settlement consisted in the demolition
of the System which before held the two
Countries together. Let me not be understood
as expressing any regret at the termination of that
System. I disapproved of it, because I thought it
was one unworthy the liberality of Great Britain,
and injurious to the interests of Ireland. But to
call that a System in itself—to call that a glorious
fabric of human wisdom—which is no more than the
mere demolition of another System—is a perversion
of terms which, however prevalent of late, can
only be the effect of gross misconception, or of
great hypocrisy. We boast that we have done
every thing, when we have merely destroyed all
that before existed, without substituting any thing
in its place. Such was the <i>Final Adjustment</i> of
1782; and I can prove it to be so, not only from
the plainest reasoning, but I can prove it by the
opinion expressed by the British Parliament at
that very time. I can prove it by the opinion
expressed by those very Ministers by whom it
was proposed and conducted. I refer, for what
I have said, to proofs which they will find it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
very difficult to answer; I mean their own acts,
which will plainly shew that they were of opinion
that a new System would be necessary. But, Sir, I
will go farther—I will also produce the authority
of one of those whose influence, on the present occasion,
has been peculiarly exerted to prevent the
discussion of the question in Ireland—of one, of
whom I do not wish to speak but with respect,
but for whom, nevertheless, I should convey an
idea of more respect, than I can now feel to be
due to him, if I were merely to describe him as
the person who fills the same situation, in the
House of Commons of Ireland, which you, Sir,
hold among us, and of which on all occasions <i>you</i>
discharge the duties with a dignity and impartiality
which reflects so much credit on yourself,
and so well supports the character and authority
of the House.</p>

<p>On a former night, I read an Extract from
the Journals, to shew what was the opinion even
of those by whom the Final Adjustment was proposed
on that Measure. It would there appear,
that the Message was sent to the Parliament of
Ireland, recommending to them the adoption of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
some Plan for a Final Adjustment between the
two Countries, and wishing to know what were
the grounds of the grievances of which they complained.
In answer to this Message, the Parliament
of Ireland stated certain grievances, the principal
of which was, the power claimed by the Parliament
of Great Britain of making Laws to bind Ireland;
but, with respect to that part of the Message
which related to the propriety of adopting
some Measures for a Final Adjustment between
the two Countries, they were wholly silent. This
Address was laid before the Parliament of Great Britain,
to whom a similar Message had been previously
sent, and on that ground was moved the Repeal
of what was called the Declaratory Act, which
Motion was assented to by the British Parliament.
This satisfaction was compleat to Ireland, as far as
related to the grievance of which her Parliament
had complained, viz. the Power of the British
Parliament of making Laws for Ireland, because,
by the Repeal of the Declaratory Act, that power
was given up. But so far was the Minister of
that day from considering that the Repeal of that
Law finally terminated all differences, and established
the Connection between the two Countries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
upon a solid basis, that he thought it necessary
to move that a farther Settlement was indispensable
for the maintenance of that Connection.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt</span> continued. Sir, I have stated the
substance of the Journals correctly; they were
read on a former night, and the Honourable Gentleman
may, if he chooses, have them read again.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
If he does he will find that they fully justify the
statement I have made, but I beg that at present
I may not be interrupted. I do maintain, that
upon a reference to the Journals of the period to
which I have alluded, it will appear that a farther
agreement between Great Britain and Ireland is
there dated, in the opinion of the Administration
of the day, to be absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>I beg farther to state, that after the motion for the
Bill of which so much has been said, was passed, an
Address to <span class="smcap">His Majesty</span> was moved and carried,
praying him to take such further measures as to
him seemed proper, to strengthen the Connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
between the two Countries. <span class="smcap">His Majesty’s</span>
most Gracious Answer, stating, that in compliance
with the Address, he would immediately take
such measures as might be necessary for that purpose,
was delivered to the House by an Honourable
Gentleman who then filled the office of Secretary
of State, and whom we have not lately
seen in the House, though he still continues to be
a Member of it. I do assert, without the least
fear of contradiction from any Gentleman whatever,
that it was in the contemplation of the Government
of that day, to adopt some measures of
the nature alluded to in the Address; since that
period, however, no such measure has been taken.
I do also maintain, that that very system which
by these very Ministers who brought it forward
was found to be imperfect, even for the purpose
of maintaining the Connection between the two
Countries, remains at this moment in the same
imperfect state. It leaves the two Countries with
separate and independent Legislatures, connected
only with this tie, that the Third Estate in both
Countries is the same—that the Executive Government
is the same—that the Crown exercises
its power of assenting to Irish Acts of Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
under the Great Seal of Great Britain, and by the
advice of British Ministers.</p>

<p>This is the only principle of Connection which
is left by the Final Adjustment of 1782. Whether
this is a sufficient tie to unite them in time of
Peace; whether in time of War it is sufficient to
consolidate their strength against a Common Enemy;
whether it is sufficient to guard against those
local jealousies which must necessarily sometimes
exist between countries so connected; whether it
is calculated to give to Ireland all the important
commercial and political advantages which she
would derive from a closer Connection with Great
Britain; whether it can give to both Nations
that degree of strength and prosperity which must
be the result of such a Measure as the present, I
believe needs only to be stated to be decided.</p>

<p>But I have already said, that I have upon this
point, the authority of an opinion to which I before
alluded—an opinion delivered upon a very
important Measure, very soon after the Final Adjustment
of 1782. The Measure to which I refer,
was that of the Commercial Propositions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
were brought forward in 1785. I am not now
going to enter into a discussion of the merits of
that Measure. The best, perhaps, that can be
said of it is, that it went as far as circumstances
would then permit, to draw the two Countries to a
closer Connection. But those who think that the
Adjustment of 1782 was final, and that it contained
all that was necessary for the establishment
of the Connection between the two Countries
upon a firm basis, can hardly contend that the
Commercial Propositions of 1785 were necessary
to prevent the danger of separation between the
two Countries, and to prevent the conflicting
operation of Independent Legislatures. Yet, if I
am not mistaken, there will be found, upon a reference
to better Records than those in which
Parliamentary Debates are usually stated (I mean
a statement of what passed in the discussion upon
those Propositions fourteen years ago, made, as I
have understood, by some of the principal parties
themselves) that the <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="smcap">Exchequer</span>
of that day in Ireland, in a Debate upon
the Irish Propositions, held this language—“If
this infatuated Country gives up the present offer,
she may look for it again in vain.” Here the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Right Honourable Gentleman was happily mistaken;
Ireland has again had the offer of the
same advantages, but more compleat, and in all
respects better calculated to attain their object;
and this offer the Right Honourable Gentleman
has exerted all his influence to reject. But he
goes on to say—“<span class="smcap">things cannot remain as
they are</span>—Commercial jealousy is roused—it
will increase with <i>two independent Legislatures</i>—and
without an united interest in commerce,
in a commercial Empire, political Union will
receive many shocks, and <i>separation of interest</i>
must threaten <i>separation of Connection</i>, which
every <i>honest Irishman</i> must shudder to look at,
as a possible event.”</p>

<p>Gentlemen will have the goodness to observe,
that I am not now quoting these expressions as
pledges given by that Right Honourable Gentleman
that he would support a proposal for a Union
between the two Countries, but I am adducing
them to prove that the situation of the two Countries
after the Final Adjustment of 1782, was
such, in his opinion, as led to the danger of a separation
between them. I am not now arguing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
that a Legislative Union is the only measure which
can possibly be adopted, but I am contending that
the Adjustment of 1782 was never considered as
final, by those who now state it to be so as an argument
against the consideration of the present
measure. How the Honourable Gentleman on the
other side of the House will evade this authority
I do not know;—an authority too, which,
I must observe, he seems much more inclined to
treat with respect than he was formerly.</p>

<p>But, Sir, it does not stop there. What is the
evil to which he alludes? Commercial jealousies
between two Countries acting upon the laws
of two independent Legislatures, and the danger
of those Legislatures acting in opposition to
each other.—How can this evil be remedied? By
two means only; either by some Compact entered
into by the Legislatures of the two Countries
respecting the mode of forming their commercial
regulations, or else by blending the two Legislatures
together; these are the only two means.
I defy the wit of man to point out a third. The
mode of compact was proposed in 1785, but unfortunately,
in spite of that Right Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Gentleman’s eloquence and authority, who then
stated the importance of guarding against the evil,
it so happened that doctrines, derived chiefly
from this side of the water, succeeded in convincing
the Parliament of Ireland, that it would be
inconsistent with their independence, to enter into
any compact whatever. We have then the authority
of that Right Honourable Gentleman to whom
I have so often alluded, that the unsettled state
in which the matter was left, would give “Political
Union many shocks, and lead to a separation
of Connection.” The experiment of a mutual
Compact has been tried without success; the
arrangement of that sort, which was proposed in
1785, in order to obviate the inconveniences
stated by the Right Honourable Gentleman, was
then attacked with the same success against his
authority, as another and more effectual remedy
has recently experienced under his auspices. The
result then is—you must remain in the state which
that Right Honourable Gentleman has described,
with the seeds of separation in the system now established,
and with the Connection, on which the
mutual prosperity of both countries depends in
danger of being hourly dissolved, or you must again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
recur to the proposal of a compact similar to that
rejected in 1785, or you must resort to the best
and most effectual remedy,—<span class="smcap">a Legislative
Union</span>.</p>

<p>I have dwelt longer, perhaps, upon this part of
the subject than was absolutely necessary, because
I believe there is scarcely any man who has ever
asked himself, whether there is a solid, permanent
system of Connection between the two Countries,
who could, upon reflection, answer the
question in the affirmative. But besides the authorities
of the persons who made the arrangement
in 1782, and of those who have since treated
of it, to shew that it was not deemed to be final
and complete; I have further the test of experience
to shew how imperfect it was, and how inadequate
in practice to the great object of cementing
the Connection, and placing it beyond
the danger of being dissolved. In the single instance,
which has occurred, (and that a melancholy
one which all of us deplored,) in which we could
feel the effects of two jarring Legislatures, We
did feel it. On that occasion, it might have
produced the most signal calamities, had we not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
been rescued from its danger by an event, to which
no man can now look back without feeling the utmost
joy and exultation; feelings, which subsequent
circumstances have served to heighten and
confirm. Every Gentleman will know, that I
must allude to the Regency. With two independent
Legislatures, acting upon different principles,
it was accident alone that preserved the identity of
the Executive Power, which is the bond and security
of the Connection: And even then the
Executive authority, though vested in one person,
would have been held by two different
tenures, by one tenure in England, by another
in Ireland, had not the interposition of Providence
prevented a circumstance pregnant with
the most imminent perils, and which might
have operated to a separation of the two kingdoms.</p>

<p>After seeing the recorded opinion of Parliament,
of those who made the arrangement of 1782, and
after the decided testimony of experience on the
subject, within the short period of sixteen years,
perhaps, it is hardly necessary to appeal to farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
proofs of its inadequacy, or to desire Gentlemen to
look forward to possible cases, which I could easily
put, and which will naturally suggest themselves to
the minds of all, who chuse to turn their attention
to the subject.</p>

<p>But when we consider the distinct powers possessed
by the two Legislatures on all the great
questions of Peace and War, of alliances and confederacies,—(for
they each have in principle, a
right to discuss them and decide upon them,
though one of them has hitherto been wisely restrained
by discretion, from the exercise of that
right),—have we not seen circumstances to induce
us to think it possible, at least, that on some of
these important questions the opinions and decisions
of the two Parliaments might have been at
variance? Are we talking of an indissoluble Connection,
when we see it thus perpetually liable
to be endangered? Can we really think that
the interests of the Empire, or of its different
branches rest upon a safe and solid basis at present?
I am anxious to discuss this point closely
with any man, either here, or in Ireland. Will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
it be said, that the Parliament of the latter Country
is bound by our decision on the question of
Peace or War? And if not so bound, will any
man, looking at human Nature as it is, contend,
that there is a sufficient certainty that the decision
on that important subject will always be the
same in both countries? I should be glad to receive
a distinct answer to this question, from the
Honourable Gentleman who has declared himself
to be as warm a friend to the Connection between
the two Countries as I am.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that the present war,
which the Parliament of Great Britain considers
to be just and necessary, had been voted by the
Irish Parliament, to be unjust, unnecessary, extravagant,
and hostile to the principles of humanity
and freedom.—Would that Parliament have
been bound by this Country? If not;—what security
have we, at a moment the most important to
our common interest and common salvation, that
the two Kingdoms should have but one friend and
one foe? I repeat it; I am eager to hear what can
be said in justification of a basis so imperfect and unsound,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
and liable to be shaken by so many accidents.
I have already observed, that in the peculiar
circumstances of the present moment, we
may find stronger reasons to prove the necessity of
correcting the system of Connection between this
Country and Ireland, of supplying its imperfections,
and strengthening its weakness, than are to
be found at any former period.</p>

<p>Having thus stated, Sir, and I think sufficiently
proved, that the Settlement of 1782, in every
point of view in which it can be considered, is
imperfect, and inadequate to the object of maintaining
the connection between the two kingdoms,
I proceed next to the circumstances which peculiarly
call upon us at the present moment to remedy
that imperfection.</p>

<p>This Country is at this time engaged in the
most important, and momentous conflict, that ever
occurred in the History of the World; a conflict
in which Great Britain is distinguished for having
made the only manly and successful stand against
the common enemies of civilized society. We
see the point in which that Enemy think us the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
most assailable—Are we not then bound in policy
and prudence, to strengthen that vulnerable point,
involved as we are in a contest of Liberty against
Despotism—of Property against Plunder and Rapine—of
Religion and Order against Impiety and
Anarchy? There was a time when this would
have been termed declamation; but, unfortunately,
long and bitter experience has taught us to feel that
it is only the feeble and imperfect representation
of those calamities (the result of French Principles
and French Arms), which are every day attested
by the wounds of a bleeding world.</p>

<p>Is there a man who does not admit the importance
of a measure which, at such a crisis, may
augment the strength of the Empire, and thereby
ensure its safety? Would not that benefit to
Ireland be of itself so solid, so inestimable, that,
in comparison with it, all Commercial Interests,
and the preservation of local habits and manners,
would be trifling, even if they were endangered
by the present measure;—which they undoubtedly
are not? The people of Ireland are proud, I believe,
of being associated with us in the great
contest in which we are engaged, and must feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the advantage of augmenting the general force of
the Empire. That the present measure is calculated
to produce that effect, is a proposition which
I think cannot be disputed. There is not in any
Court of Europe a Statesman so ill informed as
not to know, that the general power of the Empire
would be increased to a very great extent
indeed, by such a consolidation of the strength
of the two Kingdoms. In the course of the Century
every writer of any information on the subject
has held the same language, and in the general
strength of the Empire both Kingdoms are
more concerned than in any particular interests
which may belong to either. If we were to ask
the Ministers of our Allies, what measure they
thought the most likely to augment the power
of the British Empire, and consequently increase
that strength by which they were now protected—if
we were to ask the Agent of our Enemies,
what measure would be the most likely to render
their designs abortive—the answer would be the
same in both cases, viz. the firm consolidation
of every part of the Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>There is another consideration well worth attention.
Recollect what are the peculiar means by
which we have been enabled to resist the unequalled
and eccentric efforts of France, without any diminution,
nay, with an increase, of our general prosperity—what,
but the great Commercial Resources
which we possess? A Measure, then,
which must communicate to such a mighty Limb
of the Empire as Ireland, all the Commercial
advantages which Great Britain possesses, which
will open the markets of the one Country to the
other, which will give them both the common
use of their Capital, must, by diffusing a large
portion of wealth into Ireland, considerably increase
the Resources, and consequently the
strength, of the whole Empire.</p>

<p>But it is not merely in this general view, that
I think the Question ought to be considered.—We
ought to look to it with a view peculiarly
to the permanent interest and security of Ireland.
When that Country was threatened with the double
danger of hostile attacks by Enemies without,
and of Treason within, from what quarter did she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
derive the means of her deliverance?—from the
Naval Force of Great Britain—from the voluntary
exertions of her Military of every description,
not called for by Law—and from her pecuniary
resources, added to the loyalty and energy of the
Inhabitants of Ireland itself;—of which it is impossible
to speak with too much praise, and which
shews how well they deserve to be called the
Brethren of Britons. Their own courage might,
perhaps, have ultimately succeeded, in repelling
the dangers by which they were threatened, but
it would have been after a long contest, and after
having waded through seas of blood. Are we
sure that the same ready and effectual assistance
which we have happily afforded, on the present
occasion, will be always equally within our power?
Great Britain has always felt a common interest
in the safety of Ireland; but that common interest
was never so obvious and urgent as when the
Common Enemy made her attack upon Great
Britain, through the medium of Ireland, and when
their attack upon Ireland went to deprive her of her
Connection with Great Britain, and to substitute
in stead, the new Government of the French Republic.
When that danger threatened Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the purse of Great Britain was open for the wants
of Ireland, as for the necessities of England.</p>

<p>I do not, Sir, state these circumstances, as upbraiding
Ireland for the benefits we have conferred;
far from it; but I state them with pleasure,
as shewing the friendship and good will with
which this Country has acted towards her. But
if struggles of this sort may and must return
again, if the worst dangers are those which are yet
to come, dangers which may be greater from being
more disguised—if those situations may arise when
the same means of relief are not in our power,
what is the remedy that reason and policy point
out? It is to identify them with us—it is to make
them part of the same Community, by giving
them a full share of those accumulated blessings
which are diffused throughout Great Britain; it is,
in a word, by giving them a full participation of
the Wealth, the Power, and the Stability, of the
British Empire. If then this Measure comes recommended
not only by the obvious defects of
the system which now exists, but that it has also
the pre-eminent recommendation of increasing the
general power of the Empire, and of guarding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
against future danger from the Common Enemy,
we are next to consider it as to its effects upon the
internal condition of Ireland.</p>

<p>I know perfectly well, that as long as Ireland is
separated from Great Britain, any attempt on
our part to provide measures which we might
think salutary, as respecting questions of contending
sects or parties, of the claimed rights of
the Catholics, or of the precautions necessary for
the security of the Protestants—I know that all
these, though they may have been brought forward
by the very persons who are the advocates
of the Final Adjustment in 1782, were, in fact,
attacks upon the Independence of the Irish Parliament,
and attempts to usurp the Right of deciding
on points which can only be brought within
our province by Compact. Until the Kingdoms
are united, any attempt to make regulations here
for the internal state of Ireland must certainly
be a violation of her Independence. But feeling
as I do, for their interests and their welfare,
I cannot be inattentive to the events that are
passing before me; I must therefore repeat, that
whoever looks at the circumstances to which I
have alluded—whoever considers that the Enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
have shewn by their conduct, that they considered
Ireland as the weakest and most vulnerable part
of the Empire; whoever reflects upon those dreadful
and inexcusable cruelties instigated by the Enemies
of both Countries, and upon those lamentable
severities by which the exertions for the defense
of Ireland were unhappily, but unavoidably,
attended, and the necessity of which is itself one
great aggravation of the Crimes and Treasons
which led to them, must feel that, as it now stands
composed, in the hostile division of its Sects, in
the animosities existing between ancient Settlers
and original Inhabitants, in the ignorance and want
of Civilization, which marks that Country more
than almost any other Country in Europe, in the
unfortunate prevalence of Jacobin Principles,
arising from these causes, and augmenting their
malignity, and which have produced that distressed
state which we now deplore; every one, I say,
who reflects upon all these circumstances, must
agree with me in thinking, that there is no cure
but in the formation of a General Imperial Legislature,
free alike from terror and from resentment,
removed from the danger and agitation,
uninfluenced by the prejudices and uninflamed by
the passions of that distracted Country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>I know that it is impossible, if we wish to consider
this subject properly, to consider it in any
other point of view than as it affects the Empire
in general. I know that the interests of the two
Countries must be taken together, and that a man
cannot speak as a true Englishman, unless he
speaks as a true Irishman, nor as a true Irishman,
unless he speaks as a true Englishman: But
if it was possible to separate them, and I could
consider myself as addressing you, not as interested
for the Empire at large, but for Ireland
alone, I should say, that it would be indispensably
necessary, for the sake of that Country, to compose
its present distractions, by the adoption of
another system:—I should say, that the establishment
of an Imperial Legislature was the only
means of healing its wounds and of restoring it
to tranquillity. I must here take the liberty of
alluding to some topics which were touched upon
during the discussion of the former night.</p>

<p>Among the great and known defects of Ireland,
one of the most prominent features is, its want
of industry and a capital; how are those wants to
be supplied, but by blending more closely with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Ireland, the industry and the capital of this Country.
But, above all, in the great leading distinctions
between the People of Ireland, I mean their
religious distinctions, what is their situation?—The
Protestant feels that the claims of the Catholics
threatens the existence of the Protestant
ascendancy; while, on the other hand, the great
body of Catholics feel the establishment of the
National Church, and their exclusion from the
exercise of certain rights, and privileges, a grievance.
Between the two, it becomes a matter of
difficulty in the minds of many persons, whether it
would be better to listen only to the fears of the
former, or to grant the claims of the latter.</p>

<p>I am well aware that the subject of religious
distinction is a dangerous and delicate topic, especially
when applied to a country such as Ireland;
the situation of which is different in this respect
from that of every other. Where the established
religion of the State is the same as the general
religion of the Empire, and where the property
of the Country is in the hands of a comparatively
small number of persons professing that
established religion, while the religion of a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
majority of the people is different, it is not easy
to say, on general principles, what system of
Church Establishment in such a Country would
be free from difficulty and inconvenience. By
many I know it will be contended, that the religion
professed by a majority of the people, would
at least be entitled to an equality of Privileges.
I have heard such an argument urged in this
House; but those who apply it without qualification
to the case of Ireland, forget surely the
principles on which English Interest and English
Connection has been established in that Country,
and on which its present Legislature is formed.
No man can say, that, in the present State of
things, and while Ireland remains a separate kingdom,
full concessions could be made to the Catholics,
without endangering the State, and shaking
the Constitution of Ireland to its centre.</p>

<p>On the other hand, without anticipating the
discussion, or the propriety of agitating the question,
or saying how soon or how late it may be
fit to discuss it; two propositions are indisputable:
First, When the conduct of the Catholics shall be
such as to make it safe for the Government to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
admit them to the participation of the privileges
granted to those of the Established Religion, and
when the temper of the times shall be favourable
to such a measure;—When these events take
place, it is obvious that such a question may be
agitated in an United, Imperial Parliament, with
much greater safety, than it could be in a separate
Legislature. In the second place, I think it certain
that, even for whatever period it may
be thought necessary, after the Union, to withhold
from the Catholics the enjoyment of those
advantages, many of the objections which at present
arise out of their situation would be removed,
if the Protestant Legislature were no longer separate
and local, but general and Imperial; and
the Catholics themselves would at once feel a mitigation
of the most goading and irritating of their
present causes of complaint.</p>

<p>How far, in addition to this great and leading
consideration, it may also be wise and practicable
to accompany the measure by some mode of relieving
the lower orders from the pressure of
Tithes, which in many instances operate at present
as a great practical evil, or to make, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
proper Regulations, and without breaking in on
the security of the present Protestant Establishment,
an effectual and adequate provision for the
Catholic Clergy, it is not now necessary to discuss.
It is sufficient to say, that these, and all other subordinate
points connected with the same subject,
are more likely to be permanently and satisfactorily
settled by an United Legislature, than by any
local arrangements. On these grounds I contend,
that with a view to providing an effectual remedy
for the distractions which have unhappily prevailed
in Ireland, with a view of removing those
causes which have endangered, and still endanger
its security, the measure which I am now proposing
promises to be more effectual than any
other which can be devised, and on these grounds
alone, if there existed no other, I should feel it
my duty to submit it to the House.</p>

<p>But, Sir, though what I have thus stated relates
most immediately to the great object of
healing the dissentions, and providing for the
internal tranquillity of Ireland; there are also
other objects which, though comparatively with
this of inferior importance, are yet in themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
highly material, and in a secondary view,
well worthy of attention.</p>

<p>I have heard it asked, when I pressed the measure,
what are the positive advantages that Ireland
is to derive from it? To this very question I
presume the considerations which I have already
urged afford a sufficient answer. But, in fact,
the question itself is to be considered in another
view; and it will be found to bear some resemblance
to a question which has been repeatedly
put, by some of the Gentlemen opposite to me,
during the last six years. What are the advantages
which Great Britain has gained by the present
war with France?</p>

<p>To this, the brilliant successes of the British
arms by sea and land, our unexampled naval
victories over all our enemies, the solid acquisition
of valuable territory, the general increase of
our power, the progressive extension of our commerce,
and a series of events more glorious than
any that ever adorned the page of our history,
afford at once an ample and a satisfactory answer.
But there is another general answer which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
have uniformly given, and which would alone be
sufficient; it is, that we did not enter into this
war for any purpose of ambition; our object was
not to acquire, but to preserve; and in this sense,
what we have gained by the war is, in one word,
all that we should have lost without it: it is, the
preservation of our Constitution, our Independence,
our Honour, our Existence as a Nation.</p>

<p>In the same manner I might answer the question
with respect to Ireland; I might enumerate the
general advantages which Ireland would derive
from the effects of the Arrangement to which I
have already referred: The Protection which she
will secure to herself in the hour of danger. The
most effectual means of increasing her Commerce
and improving her Agriculture, the command of
English Capital, the infusion of English Manners
and English Industry, necessarily tending to ameliorate
her Condition, to accelerate the progress of
internal civilization, and to terminate those feuds
and dissentions which now distract the Country,
and which she does not possess, within herself, the
power either to controul or to extinguish. She
would see the avenue to Honours, to Distinctions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and exalted Situations in the general seat of Empire,
opened to all those whose abilities and talents
enable them to indulge an honourable and laudable
ambition.</p>

<p>But, independent of all these advantages, I
might also answer, that the question is not what
Ireland is to gain, but what she is to preserve;
not merely how she may best improve her situation,
but how she is to avert a pressing and immediate
danger. In this view, what she gains is the
preservation of all those blessings arising from the
British Constitution, and which are inseparable
from her Connection with Great Britain. Those
Blessings of which it has long been the aim of
France, in conjunction with domestic traitors, to
deprive her, and on their ruins to establish (with
all its attendant miseries and horrors) a Jacobin
Republic, founded on French Influence, and existing
only in subserviency to France.</p>

<p>Such, Sir, would be the answer, if we direct
our attention only to the question of general advantage.
And here I should be inclined to stop;
but since it has also been more particularly asked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
what are the advantages which she is to gain, in
point of Commerce and Manufactures, I am desirous
of applying my answer more immediately
and distinctly to that part of the subject: and, as
I know that the statement will carry more conviction
with it, to those who make the inquiry,
if given in the words of the Right Honourable
Gentleman, to whom, and to whose opinions, I
have had more than one occasion to advert in the
course of this night, I will read you an extract
from his recorded sentiments on the subject, in the
year 1785, on this same memorable occasion of
the Commercial Propositions. Speaking of a solid
and unalterable Compact between the two
Countries, speaking expressly of the peculiar importance
of insuring the continuance of those
Commercial benefits, which she at that time held
only at the discretion of this country, he says—“The
exportation of Irish Products, to England,
amounts to Two Millions and a Half annually;
and the exportation of British Products, to Ireland,
amounts to but One Million.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to reason upon the advantage
which Ireland would derive, under such circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
from guarding against mutual prohibitions;
and he accompanies the statement, which
I have just read, with this observation—</p>

<p>“If, indeed, the Adjustment were to take
away the Benefit from Ireland, it would be a
good cause for rejecting it; but, as it for ever
confirms all the Advantages we derived from
our Linen Trade, and binds England from
making any law that can be injurious to it,
surely Gentlemen who regard that trade, and
<i>whose fortunes and rents depend on its prosperity,
will not entertain a moment’s doubt about embracing
the offer</i>.”</p>

<p>Such was the reasoning of the Irish <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>
of the <span class="smcap">Exchequer</span>; which I consider to have
been perfectly just. With reference to his late
opinions, I do not think I can more forcibly reply,
to a person who signs his name to Propositions
which declare that the ruin of the Linen Trade
of Ireland is likely to be the consequence of an
Union, than by opposing to him his own opinion.
I shall be able to strengthen the former opinion
of that Gentleman, by stating, that the progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
that has been made in Commercial advantages to
Ireland, since 1785, has been such as to render his
argument still more applicable. What is the nature
of that Commerce, explained by the same
person in so concise and forcible a manner, that
I am happy to use his own statement? He does
not confine himself to the gross amount, but gives
the articles in detail:—</p>

<p>“Britain,” he says, “imports annually from
us Two Million Five Hundred Thousand
Pounds of our products, all, or very nearly all,
duty free, and covenants never to lay a duty on
them. We import about a Million of her’s,
and raise a Revenue on almost every article of
it, and reserve the power of continuing that
Revenue. She exports to us Salt for our
Fisheries and Provisions; Hops, which we cannot
grow; Coals, which we cannot raise; Tin,
which we have not; and Bark, which we cannot
get elsewhere: and all these without reserving
any duty.”</p>

<p>I will not tire the patience of the House, by
reading farther extracts; but the Right Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Gentleman’s whole Speech, in like manner,
points out the advantages of the Commercial
Propositions (at that time under consideration) as
a ground-work of a Compact between the two
Countries, in 1785, on Commercial subjects.—But
how stands the case now? The trade is at
this time infinitely more advantageous to Ireland.
It will be proved, from the documents which I
hold in my hand, as far as relates to the mere
interchange of manufactures, that the manufactures,
exported to Ireland from Great Britain,
in 1797, very little exceeded a Million sterling
(the articles of produce amount to nearly the same
sum) while Great Britain, on the other hand, imported
from Ireland to the amount of near Three
Millions in the manufactured articles of Linen and
Linen Yarn, and between Two and Three Millions
in Provisions and Cattle, besides Corn and
other articles of produce.</p>

<p>In addition to these Articles, there are other
circumstances of advantage to Ireland. Articles
which are essential to her trade and to her subsistence,
or serve as raw materials for her manufactures,
are sent from hence free of duty. It is expressly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
stated on the same authority, that all that
we take back from Ireland was liable to a Duty
in that Country on their exports: The increasing
produce of the chief article of their
manufacture, and four-fifths of her whole export
trade, are to be ascribed, not to that <i>Independent
Legislature</i>, but, to the liberality of the British Parliament.
It is by the free admission of Linens for
our market, and the Bounties granted by the
British Parliament on its re-export, that the
Linen-Trade has been brought to the height at
which we now see it. To the Parliament of this
Country, then, it is now owing, that a Market
has been opened for her Linen to the amount of
three millions. By the Bounty we give to Ireland,
we afford her a double market for that article, and
(what is still more striking and important) we
have prevented a competition against her, arising
from the superior cheapness of the Linen-Manufactures
of the Continent, by subjecting their importation
to a Duty of thirty per cent. Nothing
would more clearly shew what would be the danger
to Ireland from the Competition in all its principal
branches of the Linen-Trade, than the simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
fact, that we even now import foreign Linens, under
this heavy duty, to an amount equal to a
seventh part of all that Ireland is able to send us,
with the preference that has been stated. By this
arrangement alone, we must therefore be considered,
either as foregoing between seven and eight
hundred thousand pounds per annum in revenue,
which we should collect if we chose to levy the
same duty on all Linens, Irish as well as Foreign,
or on the other hand, as sacrificing perhaps at
least a million sterling in the price paid for those
articles, by the subjects of this Country, which
might be saved, if we allowed the importation of
all Linen, Foreign as well as Irish, equally free
from Duty.</p>

<p>The present measure is, however, in its effects
calculated not merely for a confirmation of the
advantages on which the person to whom I have
alluded has insisted. It is obvious that a fuller
and more perfect Connection of the two Countries,
from whatever cause it may arise, must produce
a greater facility and freedom of commercial intercourse,
and ultimately tend to the advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
both. The benefits to be derived to either Country
from such an arrangement must indeed, in a
great measure, be gradual; but they are not on
that account the less certain, and they cannot be
stated in more forcible language than in that used
in the Speech to which I have referred.—</p>

<p>“Gentlemen undervalue the reduction of British
Duties on our Manufactures. I agree with
them it may not operate soon, but we are to
look forward to a final settlement, and it is impossible
but that in time, with as good climate,
equal natural powers, cheaper food, and fewer
taxes, we must be able to sell to them. When
commercial jealousy shall be banished by final
settlement, and Trade take its natural and steady
course, the Kingdoms will cease to look to
rivalship, each will make that fabrick which it
can do cheapest, and buy from the other what
it cannot make so advantageously. Labour
will be then truly employed to profit, not diverted
by Bounties, Jealousies, or Legislative
Interference, from its natural and beneficial
course. This system will attain its real object,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
consolidating the strength of the remaining parts
of the Empire, by encouraging the communications
of their market among themselves, with
preference to every part against all strangers!”</p>

<p>I am at least, therefore, secure from the design
of appearing to deliver any partial or chimerical
opinion of my own, when I thus state, on the
authority of a person the best informed, and who
then judged dispassionately, both the infinite importance
to Ireland of securing permanently the
great commercial advantages which she now holds
at the discretion of Great Britain, and the additional
benefit which she would derive from any
settlement which opened to her gradually a still
more free and compleat commercial intercourse
with this Country. And while I state thus strongly
the commercial advantages to the sister Kingdom,
I have no alarm left I should excite any sentiment
of jealousy here. I know that the inhabitants
of Great Britain wish well to the prosperity
of Ireland;—that, if the Kingdoms are really and
solidly united, they feel that to increase the commercial
wealth of one Country is not to diminish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
that of the other, but to increase the strength
and power of both. But to justify that sentiment,
we must be satisfied that the wealth we
are pouring into the lap of Ireland is not every
day liable to be snatched from us, and thrown
into the scale of the enemy. If therefore Ireland
is to continue, as I trust it will for ever, an essential
part of the integral strength of the British
Empire; if her strength is to be permanently
ours, and our strength to be hers, neither I, nor
any English minister, can ever be deterred by the
fear of creating jealousy in the hearts of Englishmen,
from stating the advantages of a closer
Connection, or from giving any assistance to the
Commercial Prosperity of that Kingdom.</p>

<p>If ever indeed I should have the misfortune to
witness the melancholy moment when such principles
must be abandoned, when all hope of seeing
Ireland permanently and securely connected with
this country shall be at an end, I shall at least have
the consolation of knowing, that it will not be
the want of temper or forbearance, of conciliation,
of kindness, or of full explanation on our part,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
which will have produced an event so fatal to
Ireland, and so dangerous to Great Britain. If
ever the over-bearing power of prejudice and
passion shall produce that fatal consequence, it
will too late be perceived and acknowledged,
that all the great commercial advantages which
Ireland at present enjoys, and which are continually
increasing, are to be ascribed to the
liberal conduct, the fostering care, of the British
Empire, extended to the Sister Kingdom as to a
part of ourselves, and not (as has been fallaciously
and vainly pretended) to any thing which has
been done or can be done by the independent
power of her own separate Legislature.</p>

<p>I have thus, Sir, endeavoured to state to you
the reasons, why I think this Measure advisable;
why I wish it to be proposed to the Parliament
of Ireland, with temper and fairness; and why
it appears to me, entitled at least to a calm and
dispassionate discussion in that Kingdom. I am
aware, however, that objections have been urged
against the Measure, some of which are undoubtedly
plausible, and have been but too successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
in their influence on the Irish Parliament. Of
these objections I shall now proceed, as concisely
as possible, to take some notice.</p>

<p>The first is, what I heard alluded to by the
Honourable Gentleman opposite to me, when his
Majesty’s Message was brought down; namely—That
the Parliament of Ireland is incompetent
to entertain and discuss the question, or rather,
to act upon the Measure proposed, without
having previously obtained the consent of the
People of Ireland, their Constituents. But, Sir,
I am led to suppose from what the Honourable
Gentleman afterwards stated, that he made
this objection, rather by way of deprecating
the discussion of the question, than as entertaining
the smallest doubt upon it himself.—If,
however, the Honourable Gentleman, or
any other Gentleman on the other side of the
House, should seriously entertain a doubt on the
subject, I shall be ready to discuss it with him
distinctly, either this night or at any future opportunity.
For the present I will assume, that no
man can deny the competency of the Parliament
of Ireland (representing as it does, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
language of our Constitution, “<i>lawfully, fully, and
freely, all the estates of the people of the realm</i>”) to
make Laws to bind that People, unless he is disposed
to distinguish that Parliament from the Parliament
of Great Britain; and, while he maintains the
Independence of the Irish Legislature, yet denies to
it the lawful and essential powers of Parliament.—No
man, who maintains the Parliament of Ireland
to be co-equal with our own, can deny its competency
on this question, unless he means to go the
length of denying, at the same moment, the whole
of the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain—to
shake every principle of legislation—and
to maintain, that all the Acts passed, and every
thing done by Parliament, or sanctioned by its
authority, however sacred, however beneficial, is
neither more nor less than an act of usurpation.
He must not only deny the validity of the Union
between Scotland and England, but he must deny
the authority of every one of the proceedings of
the united Legislature since the Union; nay, Sir,
he must go still farther, and deny the authority
under which we now sit and deliberate here, as a
House of Parliament. Of course, he must deny
the validity of the adjustment of 1782, and call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
in question every measure which he has himself
been the most forward to have enforced. This point,
Sir, is of so much importance, that I think I ought
not to suffer the opportunity to pass, without illustrating
more fully what I mean. If this principle of
the incompetency of Parliament to the decision of
the Measure be admitted, or if it be contended, that
Parliament has no legitimate authority to discuss
and decide upon it, you will be driven to the necessity
of recognizing a principle, the most dangerous
that ever was adopted in any civilized
State. I mean the principle, that Parliament cannot
adopt any measure new in its nature, and of
great importance, without appealing to the constituent
and delegating authority for directions. If
that doctrine be true, look to what an extent it will
carry you. If such an argument could be set up
and maintained, you acted without any legitimate
authority when you created the representation of
the Principality of Wales, or of either of the
Counties Palatine of England. Every Law that
Parliament ever made, without that appeal, either
as to its own Frame and Constitution, as to the
qualification of the electors or the elected, as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
great and fundamental point of the succession to
the Crown, was a breach of Treaty, and an Act
of Usurpation.</p>

<p>If we turn to Ireland itself, what do Gentlemen
think of the power of that Parliament, which,
without any fresh delegation from its Protestant
constituents, associates to itself all the Catholic
electors, and thus destroys a fundamental distinction
on which it was formed? God forbid, that
I should object to or blame any of these Measures!
I am only stating the extent to which the
principle (that Parliament has no authority to decide
upon the present Measure) will lead; and, if
it be admitted in one case, it must be admitted
in all. Will any man say, that (although a Protestant
Parliament in Ireland, chosen exclusively
by Protestant Constituents, has by its own inherent
power, and without consulting those constituents,
admitted and comprehended the Catholics
who were till then, in fact, a separate community)
that Parliament cannot associate itself with another
Protestant community, represented by a Protestant
Parliament, having one interest with itself,
and similar in its Laws, its Constitution, and its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Established Religion? What must be said by
those who have at any time been friends to any
plan of Parliamentary Reform, and particularly to
such as have been most recently brought forward,
either in Great Britain or Ireland? Whatever
may have been thought of the propriety
of the Measure, I never heard any doubt
of the competency of Parliament to consider and
discuss it. Yet I defy any man to maintain the
principle of those plans, without contending that,
as a Member of Parliament, he possesses a right
to concur in disfranchising those who sent him to
Parliament, and to select others, by whom he
was not elected, in their stead. I am sure
that no sufficient distinction, in point of principle,
can be successfully maintained for a single
moment; nor should I deem it necessary to dwell
on this point, in the manner I do, were I not
convinced that it is connected in part with all
those false and dangerous notions on the subject
of Government which have lately become
too prevalent in the world. It may, in fact, be
traced to that gross perversion of the principles
of all political society, which rests on the supposition
that there exists continually in every Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
a Sovereignty <i>in abeyance</i> (as it were)
on the part of the People, ready to be called forth
on every occasion, or rather, on every pretence,
when it may suit the purposes of the party or
faction who are the advocates of this doctrine to
suppose an occasion for its exertion. It is in these
false principles that are contained the seeds of all
the misery, desolation, and ruin, which in the
present day have spread themselves over so large
a portion of the habitable Globe.</p>

<p>These principles, Sir, are, at length, so well known
and understood in their practical effects, that they
can no longer hope for one enlightened or intelligent
advocate, when they appear in their true
colours. Yet, with all the horror we all feel, in
common with the rest of the World, at the effect
of them, with all the confirmed and increasing
love and veneration which we feel towards the
Constitution of our Country, founded as it is,
both in Theory and Experience, on principles directly
the reverse; yet, there are too many
among us, who, while they abhor and reject such
opinions, when presented to them in their naked
deformity, suffer them in a more disguised shape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
to be gradually infused into their minds, and insensibly
to influence and bias their sentiments and
arguments on the greatest and most important
discussions. This concealed poison is now more
to be dreaded than any open attempt to support
such principles by argument or to enforce them
by arms. No society, whatever be its particular
form, can long subsist, if this principle is once
admitted. In every Government, there must reside
somewhere a supreme, absolute, and unlimited authority.
This is equally true of every lawful Monarchy—of
every Aristocracy—of every pure Democracy
(if indeed such a form of Government
ever has existed, or ever can exist)—and of those
mixed Constitutions formed and compounded from
the others, which we are justly inclined to prefer
to any of them. In all these Governments, indeed
alike, that power may by possibility be abused,
but whether the abuse is such as to justify
and call for the interference of the people collectively,
or, more properly speaking, of any portion
of it, must always be an extreme case and a
question of the greatest and most perilous responsibility,
not in Law only, but in Conscience
and in Duty, to all those who either act upon it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
themselves, or persuade others to do so. But no
provision for such a case ever has been or can
be made before-hand; it forms no chapter in
any known code of laws, it can find no place in
any system of human jurisprudence. But, above
all, if such a principle can make no part of any
established Constitution, not even of those where
the Government is so framed as to be most liable
to the abuse of its powers, it will be preposterous
indeed to suppose that it can be admitted in one
where those powers are so distributed and balanced
as to furnish the best security against the probability
of such an abuse. Shall that principle be
sanctioned as a necessary part of the best Government,
which cannot be admitted to exist as an established
check even upon the worst! Pregnant as it is
with danger and confusion, shall it be received
and authorized in proportion as every reason which
can ever make it necessary to recur to it is not likely
to exist? Yet, Sir, I know not how it is, that,
in proportion as we are less likely to have occasion
for so desperate a remedy, in proportion as a
Government is so framed as to provide within
itself the best guard and control on the exercise
of every branch of authority, to furnish the means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of preventing or correcting every abuse of power,
and to secure, by its own natural operation, a
due attention to the interest and feelings of every
part of the community, in that very proportion
persons have been found perverse enough to imagine,
that such a Constitution admits and recognizes,
as a part of it, that which is inconsistent
with the nature of any Government, and, above
all, inapplicable to our own.</p>

<p>I have said more, Sir, upon this subject than I should
have thought necessary, if I had not felt that this false
and dangerous mockery of the <i>Sovereignty of the People</i>
is in truth one of the chief elements of Jacobinism,
one of the favourite impostures to mislead
the understanding, and to flatter and inflame the
passions of the mass of mankind, who have not
the opportunity of examining and exposing it,
and that as such on every occasion, and in every
shape in which it appears, it ought to be combated
and resisted by every friend to civil order,
and to the peace and happiness of mankind.</p>

<p>Sir, the next and not the least prevalent objection,
is one which is contained in words which
are an appeal to a natural and laudable, but what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
I must call an erroneous and mistaken, sense of
national pride. It is an appeal to the generous
and noble passions of a nation easily inflamed under
any supposed attack upon its honour. I mean
the attempt to represent the question of a Union
by compact between the Parliaments of the two
Kingdoms as a question involving the Independance
of Ireland.—It has been said, that no
compensation could be made to any country for
the surrender of its National Independance. Sir,
on this, as well as on every part of the question,
I am desirous Gentlemen should come closely to
the point, that they should sift it to the bottom,
and ascertain upon what grounds and principles
their opinion really rests. Do they mean to
maintain that in any humiliating, in any degrading
sense of the word which can be acted upon practically
as a rule, and which can lead to any useful
conclusion, that at any time when the Government
of any two separate Countries unite in
forming one more extensive empire, that the individuals
who composed either of the former narrow
societies are afterwards less members of an
independant country, or to any valuable and useful
purpose less possessed of political freedom or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
civil happiness than they were before? It must
be obvious to every Gentleman who will look
at the subject, in tracing the history of all the
countries, the most proud of their present existing
independance, of all the nations in Europe,
there is not one that could exist in the state in
which it now stands, if that principle had been
acted upon by our forefathers; and Europe must
have remained to this hour in a state of ignorance
and barbarism, from the perpetual warfare of
independent and petty states. In the instance of
our own Country, it would be a superfluous waste
of time to enumerate the steps by which all its
parts were formed into one Kingdom; but will
any man in general assert, that in all the different
Unions which have formed the principal states of
Europe, their inhabitants have become less free,
that they have had less of which to be proud, less
scope for their own exertions, than they had in
their former situation. If this doctrine is to be
generally maintained, what becomes of the situation
at this hour of any one county of England,
or of any one county of Ireland, now united under
the independant Parliament of that Kingdom?
If it be pushed to its full extent, it is obviously
incompatible with all civil society. As the former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
principle of the sovereignty of the people strikes
at the foundation of all governments, so this is
equally hostile to all political confederacy, and
mankind must be driven back to what is called
the state of nature.</p>

<p>But while I combat this general and abstract principle,
which would operate as an objection to every
union between separate states, on the ground of the
sacrifice of independance, do I mean to contend that
there is in no case just ground for such a sentiment?
Far from it: it may become, on many occasions, the
first duty of a free and generous people. If there
exists a country which contains within itself the
means of military protection, the naval force necessary
for its defence, which furnishes objects of
industry sufficient for the subsistence of its inhabitants,
and pecuniary resources adequate to maintaining,
with dignity, the rank which it has attained
among the nations of the world; if, above
all, it enjoys the blessings of internal content and
tranquillity, and possesses a distinct constitution of
its own, the defects of which, if any, it is within
itself capable of correcting, and if that constitution
be equal, if not superior, to that of any
other in the world, or (which is nearly the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
thing) if those who live under it believe it to be
so, and fondly cherish that opinion, I can indeed
well understand that such a country must be jealous
of any measure, which, even by its own consent,
under the authority of its own lawful government,
is to associate it as a part of a larger and
more extensive empire.</p>

<p>But, Sir, if, on the other hand, it should
happen that there be a country which, against the
greatest of all dangers that threaten its peace
and security, has not adequate means of protecting
itself without the aid of another nation;
if that other be a neighbouring and kindred nation,
speaking the same language, whose laws,
whose customs, and habits are the same in principle,
but carried to a greater degree of perfection,
with a more extensive commerce, and more
abundant means of acquiring and diffusing national
wealth; the stability of whose government—the
excellence of whose constitution—is more than
ever the admiration and envy of Europe, and of
which the very Country of which we are speaking
can only boast an inadequate and imperfect
resemblance;—under such circumstances, I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
ask, what conduct would be prescribed by every
rational principle of dignity, of honour, or of interest?
I would ask, whether this is not a faithful
description of the circumstances which ought
to dispose Ireland to a Union? Whether Great
Britain is not precisely the nation with which,
on these principles, a Country, situated as Ireland
is, would desire to unite? Does a Union, under
such circumstances, by free consent, and on just
and equal terms, deserve to be branded as a proposal
for subjecting Ireland to a foreign yoke?
Is it not rather the free and voluntary association
of two great Countries, which join, for their
common benefit, in one Empire, where each
will retain its proportional weight and importance,
under the security of equal laws, reciprocal affection,
and inseparable interests, and which want
nothing but that indissoluble Connection to render
both invincible.</p>

<p>Sir, I have nearly stated all that is necessary
for me to trouble the House with; there are,
however, one or two other objections which I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
wish not entirely to pass over: One of them is, a
general notion that a Union with Great Britain
must necessarily increase one of the great evils of
Ireland, by producing depopulation in many parts
of the Country, and by increasing greatly the
number of absentees. I do not mean to deny
that this effect would, to a limited extent, take
place during a part of the year; but I think it
will not be difficult for me to prove, that this
circumstance will be more than counterbalanced
by the operation of the system in other respects.</p>

<p>If it be true that this measure has an inevitable
tendency to admit the introduction of that British
Capital which is most likely to give life to
all the operations of Commerce, and to all the
improvements of Agriculture; if it be that which
above all other considerations is most likely to
give security, quiet, and internal repose to Ireland;
if it is likely to remove the chief bar to
the internal advancement of wealth and of civilization,
by a more intimate intercourse with England;
if it is more likely to communicate from
hence those habits which distinguish this Country,
and which, by a continued gradation, unite the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
highest and the lowest orders of the community
without a chasm in any part of the system; if it
is not only likely to invite (as I have already said)
English Capital to set Commerce in motion, but to
offer it the use of new markets, to open fresh resources
of wealth and industry; can wealth, can industry,
can civilization increase among the whole
bulk of the people without much more than counterbalancing
the partial effect of the removal of the
few individuals who, for a small part of the year,
would follow the seat of Legislation? If, notwithstanding
the absence of Parliament from Dublin, it
would still remain the centre of Education and of
the internal commerce of a country increasing in
improvement; if it would still remain the seat of
legal discussion, which must always increase with an
increase of property and occupation, will it be
supposed, with a view even to the interests of those
whose partial interests have been most successfully
appealed to; with a view either to the respectable
Body of the Bar, to the Merchant, or Shopkeeper,
of Dublin (if it were possible to suppose that a
transaction of this sort ought to be referred to that
single criterion) that they would not find their
proportionate share of advantage in the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
advantage of the State? Let it be remembered,
also, that if the transfer of the Seat of Legislature
may call from Ireland to England the Members
of the United Parliament, yet, after the
Union, property, influence and consideration in
Ireland will lead, as much as in Great Britain, to
all the objects of imperial ambition; and there
must, consequently, exist a new incitement to
persons to acquire property in that Country, and
to those who possess it, to reside there and to cultivate
the good opinion of those with whom they
live, and to extend and improve their influence
and connections.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I need not dwell longer on argument,
however it may satisfy my own mind, because we
can on this question refer to experience. I see every
Gentleman anticipates that I allude to Scotland.
What has been the result of the Union there?
A Union, give me leave to say, as much opposed,
and by much the same arguments, prejudices,
and misconceptions, as are urged, at this
moment, creating too the same alarms, and provoking
the same outrages, as have lately taken
place in Dublin. Look at the metropolis of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Scotland: the population of Edinburgh has been
more than doubled since the Union, and a new
city added to the old. But we may be told, that
Edinburgh has engrossed all the commerce of that
country, and has those advantages which Dublin
cannot expect. Yet while Edinburgh, deprived
of its Parliament, but retaining, as Dublin would
retain, its Courts of Justice; continuing, as
Dublin would continue, the resort of those whose
circumstances would not permit them to visit a
distant metropolis; continuing, as Dublin would
continue, the seat of national education, while
Edinburgh has baffled all the predictions of that
period, what has been the situation of Glasgow?
The population of Glasgow, since the Union, has
increased in the proportion of between five and
six to one: look at its progress in manufactures;
look at its general advantages, and tell me what
ground there is, judging by experience in aid of
theory, for those gloomy apprehensions which
have been so industriously excited.</p>

<p>There remains, Sir, another general line of
argument, which I have already anticipated, and
I hope answered, that the commercial privileges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
now enjoyed by Ireland, and to which it owes so
much of its prosperity, would be less secure than
at present. I have given an answer to that already,
by stating that they are falsely imputed to the independence
of the Irish Parliament, for that they are
in fact owing to the exercise of the voluntary discretion
of the British Parliament, unbound by
compact, prompted only by its natural disposition
to consider the interests of Ireland the same as its
own; and if that has been done while Ireland is
only united to us in the imperfect and precarious
manner in which it is, while it has a separate Parliament,
notwithstanding the commercial jealousies
of our own manufactures; if under these circumstances
we have done so, if we have done so with
no other connection than that which now subsists,
and while Ireland has no share in our representation;
what fresh ground can there be for apprehension,
when she will have her proportionate
weight in the Legislature, and will be united with
us as closely as Lancashire or Yorkshire, or any
other county in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Sir, I have seen it under the same authority to
which I am sorry so often to advert, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Linen Trade would be injured, and that there
will be no security for its retaining its present
advantages. I have already stated to you (and with
that very authority in my favour) that those advantages
are at present precarious, and that their
security can only arise from Compact with Great
Britain. Such a Compact, this Measure would
establish in the most solemn manner; but besides
this, Sir, the natural policy of this Country,
not merely its experienced liberality, but the
identity of Interests after a Union, would offer a
security worth a thousand Compacts.</p>

<p>Sir, the only other general topic of objection
is that upon which great pains have been taken
to raise an alarm in Ireland—the idea that the
main principle of the Measure was to subject
Ireland to a load of Debt and an increase of
Taxes, and to expose her to the consequences of
all our alleged difficulties and supposed necessities.</p>

<p>Sir, I hope the zeal, the spirit, and the liberal
and enlarged policy, of this Country, has given
ample proof that it is not from a pecuniary
motive that we seek an Union. If it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
desirable on the grounds I have stated, it cannot
be recommended for the mere purpose of Taxation;
but to quiet any jealousy on this subject,
here again let us look to Scotland: is there
any instance where, with 45 Members on
her part and 513 on ours, that part of
the United Kingdom has paid more than its
proportion to the general burdens?—Is it
then, Sir, any ground of apprehension, that we
are likely to tax Ireland more heavily when she
becomes associated with ourselves?—To tax in
its due proportion the whole of the Empire, to
the utter exclusion of the idea of the predominance
of one part of society over another, is the
great characteristic of British Finance, as Equality
of Laws is of the British Constitution.</p>

<p>But, Sir, in addition to this, if we come to the
details of this proposition, it is in our power to
fix, for any number of years which shall be
thought fit, the proportion by which the Contribution
of Ireland, to the expences of the State,
shall be regulated; that these proportions shall not
be such as would make a contribution greater than
the necessary amount of its own present necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
expences as a separate Kingdom; and, even after
that limited period, the proportion of the whole
contribution, from time to time, might be made
to depend on the comparative produce, in each
Kingdom, of such general taxes as might be
thought to afford the best criterion of their respective
wealth. Or, what I should hope would
be found practicable, the system of internal taxation
in each country might gradually be so equalized
and assimilated, on the leading articles, as
to make all rules of specific proportion unnecessary,
and to secure, that Ireland shall never be
taxed but in proportion as we tax ourselves.</p>

<p>The application of these principles, however,
will form matter of future discussion; I mention
them only as strongly shewing, from the misrepresentation
which has taken place on this part of
the subject, how incumbent it is upon the House
to receive these propositions, and to adopt, after
due deliberation, such resolutions as may record
to Ireland the terms upon which we are ready to
meet her. And, in the mean time, let us wait,
not without impatience, but without dissatisfaction,
for that moment, when the effect of reason and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
discussion may reconcile the minds of men, in that
Kingdom, to a Measure which I am sure will be
found as necessary for their peace and happiness,
as it will be conducive to the general security
and advantage of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Sir, it remains for me only to lay these Resolutions
before the House, wishing that the more
detailed discussion of them may be reserved to a
future day.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RESOLUTIONS">RESOLUTIONS.</h2>

</div>

<h3>FIRST.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That in order to promote and secure the essential Interests
of Great Britain and Ireland, and to consolidate the
Strength, Power, and Resources of the British Empire,
it will be advisable to concur in such measures as may best
tend to unite the two Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland
into one Kingdom, in such manner, and on such Terms
and Conditions as may be established by Acts of the respective
Parliaments of His Majesty’s said Kingdoms.</p>

<h3>SECOND.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That it appears to this Committee that it would be fit to
propose as the first Article to serve as a Basis of the said
Union, that the said Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland
shall, upon a day to be agreed upon, be united into one
Kingdom, by the name of the <span class="smcap">United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<h3>THIRD.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee,
that it would be fit to propose that the Succession to the
Monarchy and the Imperial Crown of the said United
Kingdoms, shall continue limited and settled, in the same
manner as the Imperial Crown of the said Kingdoms of
Great Britain and Ireland now stands limited and settled,
according to the existing Laws, and to the Terms of the
Union between England and Scotland.</p>

<h3>FOURTH.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee,
that it would be fit to propose that the said United Kingdom
be represented in one and the same Parliament, to be
stiled the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, and that such a number of Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and such a number of Members of the
House of Commons as shall be hereafter agreed upon by
Acts of the respective Parliaments as aforesaid, shall sit and
vote in the said Parliament on the part of Ireland, and shall
be summoned, chosen and returned, in such manner as shall
be fixed by an Act of the Parliament of Ireland previous to
the said Union; and that every Member hereafter to sit
and vote in the said Parliament of the United Kingdom
shall, until the said Parliament shall otherwise provide, take
and subscribe the same Oaths, and make the same Declarations
as are by Law required to be taken, subscribed and
made by the Members of the Parliaments of Great Britain
and Ireland.</p>

<h3>FIFTH.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee,
that it would be fit to propose that the Churches of
England and Ireland, and the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,
and Government thereof, shall be preserved as now
by Law Established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<h3>SIXTH.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee,
that it would be fit to propose that His Majesty’s Subjects
in Ireland shall at all times hereafter be entitled to the
same privileges, and be on the same footing in respect of
Trade and Navigation, in all Ports and Places belonging to
Great Britain, and in all cases with respect to which Treaties
shall be made by His Majesty, his Heirs or Successors,
with any Foreign Power, as His Majesty’s Subjects in Great
Britain; that no Duty shall be imposed on the Import or
Export between Great Britain and Ireland of any Articles
now Duty free; and that on other Articles there shall be
established, for a time to be limited, such a moderate rate
of equal Duties as shall, previous to the Union, be agreed
upon and approved by the respective Parliaments, subject,
after the expiration of such limited time, to be diminished
equally with respect to both Kingdoms, but in no case to
be encreased; that all Articles which may at any time hereafter
be imported into Great Britain from Foreign Parts,
shall be importable through either Kingdom into the
other, subject to the like Duties and Regulations as if the
same were imported directly from Foreign Parts; that
where any Articles, the growth, produce, or manufacture
of either Kingdom, are subject to any internal Duty in
one Kingdom, such countervailing Duties (over and above
any Duties on import to be fixed as aforesaid) shall be
imposed as shall be necessary to prevent any inequality in
that respect: and that all other matters of Trade and
Commerce other than the foregoing, and than such others
as may before the Union be specially agreed upon for the
due encouragement of the Agriculture and Manufactures
of the respective Kingdoms, shall remain to be regulated
from time to time by the United Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<h3>SEVENTH.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That for the like purpose it would be fit to propose, that
the charge arising from the payment of the Interest or Sinking
Fund for the reduction of the Principal of the Debt
incurred in either Kingdom before the Union, shall continue
to be separately defrayed by Great Britain and Ireland
respectively. That for a number of Years to be
limited, the future ordinary expences of the <span class="smcap">United
Kingdom</span>, in Peace or War, shall be defrayed by Great
Britain and Ireland jointly, according to such proportions
as shall be established by the respective Parliaments previous
to the Union; and that after the expiration of the
time to be so limited, the proportion shall not be liable
to be varied, except according to such rates and principles
as shall be in like manner agreed upon previous to
the Union.</p>

<h3>EIGHTH.</h3>

<p class="hanging">That for the like purpose it would be fit to propose, that
all Laws in force at the time of the Union, and that all
the Courts of Civil or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within the
respective Kingdoms, shall remain as now by Law established
within the same, subject only to such alterations or
regulations from time to time as circumstances may appear
to the Parliament of the <span class="smcap">United Kingdom</span> to
require.</p>

<p class="hanging">That the foregoing <span class="smcap">Resolutions</span> be laid before His
Majesty with an humble <span class="smcap">Address</span>, assuring His Majesty
that we have proceeded with the utmost attention to the
consideration of the important objects recommended to us
in His Majesty’s Gracious <span class="smcap">Message</span>.</p>

<p class="hanging">That we entertain a firm persuasion that a <span class="smcap">complete and
intire Union</span> between Great Britain and Ireland,
founded on equal and liberal Principles, on the similarity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
of Laws, Constitution and Government, and on a sense of
mutual Interests and Affections, by promoting the Security,
Wealth, and Commerce of the respective Kingdoms, and
by allaying the distractions which have unhappily prevailed
in Ireland, must afford fresh means of opposing at all times
an effectual resistance to the destructive Projects of our
Foreign and Domestic Enemies, and must tend to confirm
and augment the Stability, Power, and Resources of the
Empire.</p>

<p class="hanging">Impressed with these considerations, we feel it our duty humbly
to lay before His Majesty such Propositions as appear to
us best calculated to form the Basis of such a settlement,
leaving it to His Majesty’s wisdom, at such time and in
such manner as His Majesty, in his Parental Solicitude for
the happiness of his People, shall judge fit, to communicate
these Propositions to His Parliament of Ireland, with whom
we shall be at all times ready to concur in all such Measures
as may be found most conducive to the accomplishment of
this great and salutary Work. And we trust that, after
full and mature consideration, such a Settlement may be
framed and established, by the deliberate Consent of the
Parliaments of both Kingdoms, as may be conformable
to the Sentiments, Wishes, and real Interests of His
Majesty’s faithful Subjects of Great Britain and Ireland,
and may unite them inseparably in the full enjoyment of
the blessings of our free and invaluable Constitution, in
the support of the Honour and Dignity of His Majesty’s
Crown, and in the preservation and advancement of the
Welfare and Prosperity of the whole British Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, By the Lords Spiritual and Temporal
in Parliament assembled <i>Nemine dissentiente</i>,
That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty,
to return him our thanks for the most gracious
Message sent to this House by His Majesty’s
command, through the medium of His Grace
the Lord Lieutenant, and to assure him of our
most unshaken loyalty and attachment to His
Majesty’s person and government, and of the
lively sense we entertain of his paternal care of
his people of Ireland, in thus inquiring into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
discontents and jealousies that subsist amongst
them, in order to such Final Adjustment as may
give mutual satisfaction to his Kingdoms of Great
Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>That, thus encouraged by His Royal Interposition,
we shall beg leave, with all duty and affection,
to lay before His Majesty the cause of such
discontents and jealousies.</p>

<p>To represent to His Majesty, That his subjects
of Ireland are entitled to a free constitution;
that the Imperial Crown of Ireland is inseparably
annexed to the Crown of Great Britain, on which
Connection the happiness of both nations essentially
depends; but that the Kingdom of Ireland is a
distinct dominion, having a Parliament of her own,
the sole Legislature thereof.</p>

<p>That there is no power whatsoever competent to
make laws to bind this nation, except the King,
Lords, and Commons, of Ireland; upon which
exclusive Right of Legislation we consider the very
essence of our liberties to depend, a Right which
we claim as the Birth-right of the People of Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and which we are determined, in every situation
of life, to assert and maintain.</p>

<p>To represent to His Majesty, That we have
seen with concern certain claims, both of legislature
and judicature, asserted by the Parliament
of Great Britain, in an Act passed in Great Britain
in the sixth year of George the First, intituled
“An Act for the better securing the Dependency
of Ireland upon the Crown of Great
Britain:”</p>

<p>That we conceive the said Act, and the powers
thereby claimed, to be the great and principal
causes of the discontents and jealousies that subsist
in this Kingdom:</p>

<p>To assure His Majesty, That this House considers
it as a matter of constitutional right and
protection, that all Bills which become Law should
receive the approbation of His Majesty, under the
Seal of Great Britain; but we consider the practice
of suppressing our Bills in the Council of
Ireland, or altering them any where, to be a matter
which calls for redress:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>To represent to His Majesty, That an Act intituled
“An Act for the better Accommodation
of His Majesty’s Forces,” being unlimited in
duration, but which, from the particular circumstances
of the times, passed into a law, has been
the cause of much jealousy and discontent in this
Kingdom;</p>

<p>That we have thought it our duty to lay before
His Majesty these, the principal causes of the
discontents and jealousies subsisting in this Kingdom:</p>

<p>That we have the greatest reliance on His
Majesty’s wisdom, the most sanguine expectations
from his virtuous choice of a Chief Governor, and
the greatest confidence in the wise and constitutional
Council His Majesty has adopted:</p>

<p>That we have, moreover, a high sense and
veneration for the British Character, and do
therefore conceive, that the proceedings of this
country, founded as they are in right, and supported
by constitutional liberty, must have excited
the approbation and esteem of the British nation:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
That we are the more confirmed in this hope,
inasmuch as the people of this Kingdom have
never expressed a desire to share the freedom of
Great Britain, without at the same time declaring
their determination to share her fate, standing or
falling with the British nation.</p>

King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland, nor any
other Parliament which hath any authority or
power of any sort whatsoever in this country, save
only the Parliament of Ireland: To assure His
Majesty, that we humbly conceive, that in this
Right the very Essence of our Liberties exist; a
Right which we, on the part of all the People of
Ireland, do claim as their birth-right, and which
we cannot yield but with our lives: To assure
His Majesty, that we have seen with concern certain
Claims advanced by the Parliament of Great
Britain, in an act, intituled, “An Act for the
better securing the Dependency of Ireland;”
an act containing matter entirely irreconcileable
to the fundamental Rights of this Nation; that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
we consider this act, and the claims it advances,
to be the great and principle cause of the discontents
and jealousies in this Kingdom: To assure
His Majesty, that His Majesty’s Commons of
Ireland do most sincerely wish, that all Bills which
become Law in Ireland should receive the approbation
of His Majesty, under the Seal of Great
Britain; but that yet we do consider the Practice
of suppressing our Bills in the Council of Ireland,
or altering the same any where, to be another
just cause of discontent and jealousy: To assure
His Majesty, that an Act, intituled, “An Act
for the better Accommodation of His Majesty’s
Forces,” being unlimited in duration, and
defective in other instances (but passed in
that shape from the particular circumstances of
the times) is another just cause of discontent and
jealousy in this Kingdom: That we have submitted
these, the principal causes of the present
discontent and jealousy in Ireland, and remain in
humble expectation of redress; that we have the
greatest reliance on His Majesty’s wisdom, the
most sanguine expectations from his virtuous
choice of a Chief Governor, and great confidence
in the wise, auspicious, and constitutional councils<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
which we see with satisfaction His Majesty has
adopted; that we have moreover a high sense and
veneration for the British character, and do therefore
conceive, that the proceedings of this country,
founded as they are in right, and tempered
by duty, must have excited the approbation and
esteem, instead of wounding the pride, of the
British Nation; and we beg leave to assure His
Majesty, that we are the more confirmed in this
hope, in as much as the people of this Kingdom
have never expressed a desire to share the freedom
of England, without declaring a determination
to share her fate likewise, standing and falling
with the British nation.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
